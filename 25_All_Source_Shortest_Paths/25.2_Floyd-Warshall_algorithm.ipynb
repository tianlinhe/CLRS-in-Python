    "# 25.2 The Floyd-Warshall algorithm\n",
    "The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a **dynamic programming** approach to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths (APSP) problem in a directed graph $G=(V,E)$. The directed graph permits negative-weight edges, but we assume that no negative-weight cycles exist. For convinience, the vertices are numbered as $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$, where $n=|V|$. The algorithm:\n",
    "* run in $\\Theta (V^3)$ time\n",
    "* observes the substructure of solution $d_{ij}^{(k)}$ conditioned on the subset $\\{1,2,...,k\\}$ of vertices, from which intermediate vertices from $i$ to $j$ were drawn\n",
    "* use a bottom up approach to compute $d_{ij}^{(n)}$, which is the final solution (because intermediate vertices will be eventually drawn from $\\{1,2,...,n\\}$)\n",
    "* the intermediate and final solutions are stored in a $n\\times n$ matrices for all $i,j$ pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Python\n",
    "The below `floyd_warshall` runs on a given $n \\times n$ matrix $W$ representing the edge weights of an $n$-vertex directed graph $G=(V,E)$. Here, $W$ is a double-nested list."
