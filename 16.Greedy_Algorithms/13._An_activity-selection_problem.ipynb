    "# 16.1 An activity-selection problem\n",
    "Suppose we have a set $S=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\\}$ of $n$ proposed ***activities*** that wish to use a resource (such as a lecture hall), which can serve only one activity at a time. Each activity $a_i$ has a ***start time*** $s_i$ and a ***finish time*** $f_i$, where $0\\leq s_i<f_i<\\infity$. In the **activity-selection problem***, we sish to select a maximum-size subset of mutually compatible activites. We assume that the activities are **sorted** in monotonically increasing order of finish time $f_1\\leq f_2\\leq....\\leq f{n-1}\\leq f_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: dynaimc programming\n",
    "### Optimal substruction\n",
    "Leu us denote by $S_{ij}$ the set of activities that start **after** activity $a_i$ finishes and that finish **before** activity $a_j$ starts\n",
    "1. For the set of activies $S_{ij}$ with optimal solution $A_{ij}$, we can assume that $A_{ij}$ contains some activity called $a_k$\n",
    "2. We can show that the $A_{i,j}$ must include optimal solutions to the subproblems $S_{ik}$ and $S_{kj}$\n",
    "3. Thus, we have the recurrence $c[i,j]=c[i,k]+c[k,j]+1$, where $c[i,j]$ denotes the size (number of activities) of $A_{i,j}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that we still do not know the value of $k$, thus a iteration is needed to examine all activities in $S_{ij}$ for the size of $k$ that maximise $c[i,j]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "c[i,j]=\\left\\{\n",
    "        \\begin{array}{ll}\n",

    "## Approach 2: greedy algorithm\n",
    "### Making the greedy choice\n",
    "1. Intuition tells that we sohuld choose an activity that finish the earliest\n",
    "2. Since the activites are sorted, the first greedy choice is activity $a_1$\n",
    "3. It leaves only one subproblem to solve: finding activies that start after $a_1$, denoted by $S_1$\n",
    "4. we can repeat $2-3$ recursively until we reaches $S_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "### A recursive greedy algorithm\n",
    "The procedure `recursive_activity_selector` takes as input\n",
    "1. array $s$, the start time of activities\n",
    "2. array $f$, the finish time of activities\n",
    "3. index $k$, which define the subproblem $S_k$ to solve (e.g. $S_1$ denotes finding the optimal solution of subset $S_{1,n}$, after identifying $a_1$ as the first greedy choice of $S_{0,n}$)\n",
    "4. integer $n$, the size of the original problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the $f$ is sorted, $s$ is linked to $f$, but it is not necessarily in motonically increasing order."
