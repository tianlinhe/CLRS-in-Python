    "## Example: searching a dictionary\n",
    "Imagine looking up a word in an English-French dictionary: we could ensure an $O(\\lg n)$ search time per word by using a **red-black tree** or any other balanced binary search tree (BTS). However, words we search can appear with different frequencies: for example, assigning a high-frequency word near the leaf of the tree will slow down the search. Moreover, some words we search may not appear in the BTS at all. How can we organise a BTS, so as to **minimise the number of nodes visited** in all search, given that we know the **frequency** of each word? Here is an analog:\n",

    "We assume that the actual cost of a search equals the number of nodes examined, i.e., the depth of the node found by the search in $T$ plus $1$. The expected cost depends on both frequency of the key and **depth of the node** containing the key:\n",

    "For a given set of probabilities, we wish to construct a BTS such that its expected search cost is **minimal**. We call such a tree an ***optimal binary search tree (oBTS)***. We shall see in the following session, that a brute-force approach to check all possibilities fails to yield an efficient algorithm; instead, we can solve it with dynamic programming. \n",

What happens to the expected search cost of a subtree when itself becomes a subtree of a node? *The depth of each node in the subtree increases by $1$*. Therefore, the expected search cost of the all nodes in this subtree increases by the *sum of probabilities of all nodes* in this subtree, which can be expressed as:\n",
