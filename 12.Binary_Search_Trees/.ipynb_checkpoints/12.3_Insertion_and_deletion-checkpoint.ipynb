    "* If `z.key>x.key` $\\Rightarrow$ `x=x.left`\n",

    "In addition, we need a **trailing pointer** $y$ as $x.p$, because:\n",
    "* at the end of `while` loop, the $x$ already reached `None` (where we will assign it as $z$)\n",
    "* the trailing pointer $y$ helps us to assign parent of $z$, so that `z.p=y`\n",

    "    * replace $z$ by $y$, PLUS\n",
    "    * replace $y$ by `y.right` (notice that because `y.left` by definition does not exist, we do not have to do anything about it) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Subroutine: Transplant\n",
    "Because **DELETION** involves moving subtrees within a BTS, we can define a subrountine **TRANSPLANT**, which replaces one subtree as a child of its parent with another subtree. The procedure `tree_transplant (T, u, v)` replaces the subtree rooted at node $u$ with the subtree rooted at node $v$, so that `u.p.child=v`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The incorporation of **TRANSPLANT** in case 1 & 2 of **DELETION** is trivial, notice that Case 1 can be fused with Case 2b (see codes annotation from line 16 to 32).\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of **TRANPLANT** in case 3 needs a little more detailed explaination:\n",
    "* First identify successor $y$ of $z$ by calling `y=tree_minimum(z.right)`\n",
    "* Case 3a $\\Rightarrow$ `tree_transplant(T,z,y)` to replace node $z$ it by node $y$(*Figure 13.3-2a*)\n",

    "    * step 1) `tree_transplant(T,y,y.right)` to replace $y$ by `y.right` \n",
    "    * step 2) build a subtree, which is rooted at $y$ but has its stem and leaves as the subtree rooted at `z.right`. (*Figure 13.3-2b*)\n",

    "Observing that Case 3a & 3b share the step `tree_transplant(T,z,y)` (although we transplant nodes for Case 3b, while subtrees for Case 3b), we can design codes with shared last step for optimised running time (line ).\n",
