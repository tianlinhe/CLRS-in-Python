    "# 12.1 Binary search Tree\n",
    "A binary search tree is a **linked data structure** in which each node is an object.  Each node contains:\n",
    "* Attributes as `key` and satellite data\n",
    "* Pointers to other nodes:\n",
    "    * `left` to its left child\n",
    "    * `right` to its right child\n",
    "    * `p` to its parent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary-search-tree property:\n",
    "For a node `x` in a binary search tree:\n",
    "* Nodes in the **right subtree** of `x` have keys that are **at least** `x.key`\n",
    "* Nodes in the **left subtree** of `x` have keys that are **at most** `x.key`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tree walk\n",
    "The binary-search-tree property allows us to print out all the keys in **sorted order** by a **recursive algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inorder tree walk** prints the key of the root of a subtree *between* the key of its left subtree and that of its right subtree\n",
    "* **Preorder tree walk** prints the key of the root of a subtree *before* the key of its left subtree and that of its right subtree\n",
    "* **Postorder tree walk** prints the key of the root of a subtree *after* the key of its left subtree and that of its right subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes $\\Theta (n)$ time to walk an n-node binary search tree, because each node is called exactly **twice** during the reculsive procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following codes demonstrate the **inorder tree walk** for the tree in *Figure 12.1 a)*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/fig12.1-1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build a tree\n",
    "The following python codes can build a tree by assigning its key, left and right child manually to every node:\n",
    "1. `class Node` defines a node with `key`, `left` and `right` pointers*\n",
    "2. `class BinaryTree` starts with an empty tree whose root is `None`\n",
    "3. We start by assigning t.root `t=BinaryTree()` and set `t.root=Node(6)` so that the key of root is $6$\n",
    "4. From line 21 to line 25, we assign the keys of the remainig nodes according to its relation with `t.root`\n",
    "\n",
    "$*$ Notice that we omit the `p` pointer for simplicity, because it is not required for tree walk."
