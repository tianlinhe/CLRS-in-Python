# CLRS-in-Python
**Python codes** in ***Introduction to Algorithm***, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Riverest and Clifford Stein (**CLRS**)
## Actively recruiting contributors: 
* Beginners who are passionate in Python are also welcome!
* Want to join this exciting project? Just start from downloading a Jupyter Notebook and learn some Markdown!
