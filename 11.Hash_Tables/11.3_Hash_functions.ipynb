    "1. We can express a single alphabet with an integer according to the [ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)\n",
    "2. Using the [radix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix), we can interpret a character string composed of multiple alphabets with the ASCII integers\n",
    "3. One can choose the **base** in radix notation. For example, the **radix-128** integer of $(112,116)$ equals to $112\\times128^1+116\\times128^0=14452$\n",

    "## Universal hashing\n",
    "The key idea is to avoid worst-case behavior caused by a single hash function by **randomisation** from a class of hash functions. In universal hashing, a hash function is chosen each time **randomly** such that it is **independent** of the keys that are actually going to be stored. It yields stable and provable *average-case* performance no matter how the keys were chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By definition:\n",
    "* $\\mathscr{H}$ is a finite collection  of hash functions that map a universe $U$ of keys into the range $\\{0,1,...,m-1\\}$\n",
    "* A hash function $h$ is randomly chosen from $\\mathscr{H}$ to hash two distinct keys $k$ and $l$\n",
    "* The chance of $h(k)=h(l)$ is **no more than $1/m$**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance:\n",
    "We can prove that:\n",
    "* If the key $k$ is not in the table, the expected length of $T[h(k)]$ that it hashes to is at most the load factor $\\alpha=n/m$\n",
    "* If the key $k$ is in the table, the expected length of $T[h(k)]$ is at most $1+\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "which implies that with the use of universal hashing and chaining (to resolve collision), it takes expected time $\\Theta(n)$ to handle any sequence of $n$ INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE operations containing $O(m)$ INSERT operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Disigning a universal class of hash functions\n",
    "1. We choose a large prime number $p$ so that every possible key $k$ is in the range of 0 to $p-1$.\n",
    "2. Let $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ denotes the set $\\{0,1,...p-1\\}$, $\\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ denotes the set $\\{1,...p-1\\}$\n",
    "3. Hash function $h_{ab}$ can be defined as:\n",
