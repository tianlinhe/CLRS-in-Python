    "# Hash Tables\n",
    "When the size of the **universe *U*** is enormous, a direct-address table ***T*** of size $|U|$ becomes impractical: the set ***K*** of keys actually stored may be so small relative to ***U***, most of space allocated for ***T*** would be wasted. Therefore we will need the help of a **hash table**. When the set ***K*** of keys << **universe *U*** of all possible keys, a hash table requires much less storage.\n",
    "## Hash function\n",
    "In a hash table, each element is stored in slot $h(k)$. Here, the **hash function** $h$ is used to compute the slot from the key $k$.\n",
    "* $h$ maps the universe $U$ of keys into the slots of a hash table $T$ with size $m$:<br>\n",
    "$h:U \\rightarrow {0,1,...,m-1}$, where $m<<|U|$\n",
    "* It thus reduces the range of array indices and size of the array\n",
    "* We say that an element with key $k$ **hashes** to slot $h(k)$, or $h(k)$ as the **hash value** of key $k$. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Collision\n",
    "When two keys hash to the same slot, **collision** takes place. Becuase $|U|>m$, there must be at least two keys that have the same hash value: the collision is unaviodable. Nonetheless, we still need to minimise the number of collision. There are several ways:\n",
    "1. Choosing a **suitable hash function**:\n",
    "    1. $h$ needs to appear **random**\n",
    "    2. $h$ needs to be **deterministic**: a given input $k$ always gives the same $h(k)$\n",
    "2. By **chaining**\n",
    "3. By **open addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collision resolution by chaining\n",
    "In the hash table $T$, we place all the elements that hash to the same slot (i.e. they have the same value of $h(k)$) into a **linked list** $L$.\n",
    "* Slot $j$ in $T$ contains a pointer to the head of $L$ \n",
    "* If no elements hash to $L$, slot $j$ is `None`\n",

    "### Search (T,k)\n",
    "Search for an element with key $k$ in list `T[h(k)]`\n",
    "* *Worst-case* running time $\\propto$ the length of `T[h(k)]` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Delete (T,x)\n",
    "Delete $x$ from the list `T[h(x.key)]`\n",
    "* Running time is $O(1)$ if `T[h(k)]` is **doubly linked**\n",
    "* Running time is asymptotically the same as Search (T,k) if `T[h(k)]` is **singly linked**\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Python\n",
    "We can build a chained hash table with the use of `class DoublyLinkedList` from *10.1_Linked_list.ipynb*. It is very similar to *Exc 11.1-3*, only that we need to hash the key $k$ to slot $h(k)$ in Table $T$. Assume that we have a set of keys $K$, where $ K\\in \\mathbb{N}$. Each element `x` has a pointer `x.key`to keys in $K$ and a pointer `x.data` to its satellite data.\n",
    "1. Define a hash function $h$. In the following codes: $h(p)=p mod m$, where m is length of table $T$.\n",
    "2. $h$ will allows us to map $K$ keys to $m$ slots: $h:K \\rightarrow {0,1,...,m-1}$, where $m<<|K|$\n",
    "3. We can define each slot `T(k)` in the table such that:\n",
    "* It is a pointer to a **doubly linked list** `L` containing all the keys with the same hash value\n",
    "    * We only need to modify `class Node` slightly by adding another attribute `data` that points to satellite data. \n",
    "    * If the slot is empty, `L.head is None`\n",
    "* Special attention to **DELETE**:\n",
    "    * To run in $O(1)$, we can only assign node in the list `L` to be deleted, such as `L.head` or `L.head.next`\n",
    "    * If one wishes to delete a node with a given key value, a while loop is needed (running time $\\propto$ length of list `L`)\n"
