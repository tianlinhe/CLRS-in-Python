    "# 11.4 Open addressing\n",
    "Open addressing is a way to resolve collision, other than a chained list.\n",
    "* Each slot contains **either an element of the dynamic set or `None`** (the load factor $\\alpha$ never exceeds $1$)\n",
    "* **Pointers are avoided** so that memory can be freed to store more elements\n",
    "* Instead of following pointers, we **compute the sequence of slots** to be examined (=probed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion\n",
    "We succesively examine (probe) the hash table until we find an empty slot in which to put the key.\n",
    "* We do NOT probe in sequencial order $0,1,2,...,m-1$\n",
    "* The **sequence of slots** to be probed depends upon the **key being inserted** \n",
    "* The **sequence of slots** can be calculated with a **hash function $h$**, with the **probe number $\\{0,1,2,...,m-1\\}$** as a **second input** (the first input is the key of the element)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h:U\\times \\{0,1,2,...,m-1\\} \\rightarrow\\{0,1,2,...,m-1\\}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We require that for every key $k$, its probe sequence $\\langle h(k,0), h(k,1),..., h(k,m-1)\\rangle$ be a **permutation** of $\\langle 0, 1,..., m-1\\rangle$, so that every slot can be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search\n",
    "We probe the **same sequence of slots** to search a key $k$ as we would insert it. Therefore:\n",
    "* When the search finds an empty slot, it means that the search is unsccessful\n",
    "* The following slots to be probed are all empty, as a key $k$ can only be inserted sequentially\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deletion\n",
    "Why the deletion is difficult in open addressing? If we delted a key from slot $i$ and marke it as `None`, we might not be able to retrieve any key $k$ during **whose insertion we had probe slot $i$ and found it occupied**. As shown below in *Figure 11.4*:\n",
    "* For key $k$ with probe sequence $\\langle h(k,0), h(k,1),h(k,2)...\\rangle$,\n",
    "* If we delete the element $k_1$ that occupies slot $h(k,1)$ by replacing it with `None`,\n",
    "* `hash_search` cannot retrieve element $k_2$, or any elements $k_3, k_4,...$ that were once inserted after probing the slot $h(k,1)$.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/fig11.4_1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution is to mark the deleted slot as `deleted` instead of `None`, so that the slot can be:\n",
    "1. passed in `hash_search`\n",
    "2. regarded as `None` in `hash_search` (which means we need to modify `hash_insert`)\n",
    "Since the additional flag `deleted` renders a less efficient search, **chaining** is more commonly use as a collision resolution technique when deletion of keys is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uniform hashing\n",
    "In **uniform hashing**, the probe sequence of each key is equally likely to be any of the $m!$ permutations of $\\langle 0, 1,..., m-1\\rangle$. Although true uniform hashing is difficult to implement, the book provides three practival approximations: **linear probing**, **quadratic probing**, and **double probing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear probing\n",
    "Given an ordinary hash function $h':U\\times \\{0,1,2,...,m-1\\} \\rightarrow\\{0,1,2,...,m-1\\}$ which we refer to as an **auxiliary hash function**, linear probing uses the hash function for $i=0,1,2,...,m-1$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h(k,i)=((h'(k)+i))\\:mod\\:m=(h'(k)\\:mod\\:m)+i\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "* Because $h(k,i)$ is the modulation of $m$, it has $m$ distinct values\n",
    "* The probe sequence starts from $T[h'(k)\\:mod\\:m]$\n",
    "* It is followed by $T[(h'(k)\\:mod\\:m)+1]$, $T[(h'(k)\\:mod\\:m)+2]$..., until $T[m-1]$\n",
    "* Then starts from $T[0]$, $T[1]$ ..., and ends at $T[(h'(k)\\:mod\\:m)-1]$\n",
    "As you may see, the start of probe sequence$T[h'(k)\\:mod\\:m]$ always determines the entire probe sequence, there are only $m$ distinct probe sequence (because you can start from one of the $m$ slots). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primary Clustering\n",
    "Linear probing can suffer from **primary clustering**, in which long runs of occupied slots build up that increase the average search time. For an empty slot $T[j]$ preceded by $i$ full slots, its probability of getting filled next is $(i+1)/m$. \n",
    "<img src=\"img/fig11.4_2.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "1. When insert a key $k$, the start of its probe sequence can be any one of the $m$ slots in $T$;\n",
    "2. If this slot is filled ($P=i/m$), we will eventually insert $k$ in the slot $T[j]$\n",
    "    * because the probe sequence is an increment of $1$ of its previous term\n",
    "    * and we always insert in the first empty slot encountered\n",
    "3. Don't forget that there is $P=1/m$ chance that $T[j]$ itself is the start of the probe sequence\n",
    "4. In total we have $P=(i+1)/m$\n",
    "\n",
    "When i is larger, P grows: there is a even higher tendency to have long occupied slots!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementing linear probing in Python:\n",
    "By defining $h'$ with the division method, we can now implement the intact `hash_insert` and `hash_search` and `hash_delete` functions.\n",
    "* We assume now that the elements in the hash table $T$ are keys with no satellite information\n",
    "* Each slot contains either a key (filled), or `None` (empty)\n",
    "* `h_linear` compute the probe sequence according to linear probling\n",
    "* `hash_insert` and `hash_search` takes as input a hash table $T$ and a key $k$, and return the slot number $j$ or raise an error when the table is full/element not present respectively\n",
    "* `hash_delete` searches for the element in $T$ and flag it with `deleted`; if the element is not present, raises an error\n",
