    "There are two elements of DP: ***optimal substructure*** and ***overlapping subproblems***.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Optimal substructure\n",
    "**Optimal substructure** demands the **independency of the subproblems**; you should be careful not to assume that optimal substructure applies when it does not. A counter example is the **Unweighted longest simple path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overlapping subproblems\n",
    "When a recursive algorithm revisits the same problem repeatedly, we say that the optimization problem has ***overlapping subproblems***. DP hence 1) solve each subproblem once and 2) store the solution in a table where it can be looked up when needed. This approach is called **recursion with memiozation**.\n",

    "1. Calls in which $m[i,j]=\\infty$, so that Line 12-19 execute\n",
    "2. calls in which $m[i,j]<\\infty$, so that it simply returns $m[i,j]$ in Line 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we calculate each entry in $m$ exactly once, there are $\\Theta n^2$ calls of the first type. All calls of the second type are made as **recursive calls** by calls of the first type. Whenever a given call of `lookup_chain` makes recursive call, it makes $O(n)$ of them (i.e. from n till 1 at the base case). Therefore, there are $O(n^3)$ calls of the second type in all. Each call of the second type takes $O(1)$ time, and each call of the first type takes $O(n)$ time plus the time spent in its recursive calls. The total time is therefore $O(n^3)$.\n",

    "    * 2)less overhead for maintainig the table\n",
    "* For some problems we can exploit the regular pattern of table accesses in bottom-up DP to reduce time or space requirements event further\n",
    "* Alternatively, if some subproblems in the subproblem space need not be solved at all, the memoized solution has the advantage of solving only those subproblems that are definitely required"
